# Repo-GitLab2023
This is the ReadMe File 

The first piece of this lab was to create a new repository and add a source folder. This was delayed because the repository was missing a JRE system library.

The second piece was adding a main to inside a class in the source folder. The main included one line of code that printed a statement.

Now we are working on editing a ReadMe file and working with markdown tools. These are examples of markdown tools.

2. ~~This was a mistake~~
3. *And this is italicized*
